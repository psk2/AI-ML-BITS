In this Assignment, you will implement two classification machine learning algorithms Logistic Regression & Naive Bayes on the dataset given.

You will have 6 marks to implement each. Also, Compare the performance of each Algorithm

For the dataset (Liver disease dataset), implement the Naïve Bayes classifier using Python. [6M]

Dataset: liver_disease_1.csvPreview the document

The marks distribution is as follows

Import the libraries and Load the dataset and Remove/replace missing values (if any) [1M]

Split features and labels [0.5M]

Split train and test data [0.5M}

Implement Naïve Bayes Classifier [2M]

Calculate accuracy measures [1.5M]

 

For the same dataset (Liver disease dataset), implement classification using Logistic Regression using Python. [6M]

The marks distribution is as follows

Import the libraries and Load the dataset and Remove/replace missing values (if any) [1M]

Split features and labels [0.5M]

Split train and test data [0.5M}

Implement Logistic regression Classifier [2M]

Calculate accuracy measures [1.5M]

 

Compare the results and accuracies for both the algorithms and share your inferences. [1M]
